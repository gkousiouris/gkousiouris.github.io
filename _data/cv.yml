        - title: Performance Modeling and Estimation of Service Oriented Applications and Infrastructures
          contents:
            - The thesis involved a study on the performance prediction of applications running on virtualized infrastructures, based on application level parameters and inputs as predictors. The goal was to identify necessary needed resources for the application to achieve specific KPIs. In addition, the thesis involved the study of virtual machine performance in concurrent and multitenant environments, with relation to configuration parameters such as real time scheduling, types of applications and CPU architectures. The results were used in order to create performance models based on Artificial Neural Networks that can predict the degradation of VM performance based on the selected configuration. The ANNs were automatically created through the use of a Genetic Algorithm Optimization process in order to determine good network design (number of hidden layers, transfer functions used and number of neurons per layer). Furthermore, a decoupled service framework was developed in order to incorporate the prediction methods in a SOA based environment, incorporating components written in Java, REST protocol and GNU Octave/Matlab. Prediction models were also created in R for data activity forecasting in virtualized Hadoop clusters, in order to drive the configuration of the cluster (e.g. expand/retract the cluster size) based on anticipated workload variations.
